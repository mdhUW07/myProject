Host:    michael-hall-T590 (AVX2, FMA3, 15 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s ../alignmentmethods/muscle/Bombus_terrestris_dalmatinus-alligned-muscle.fasta
Seed:    780593 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Mar 13 13:16:51 2025
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
